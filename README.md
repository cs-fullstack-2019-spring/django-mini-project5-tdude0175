# Code School's Recipes

### Create a site for people to store and view recipes.
#### <strong>Note: Comment MOST of your view.py file. Start this project from scratch </strong>

Index/Home page/127.0.0.1: <strong>If you're logged out</strong>, welcome the user to your page. The index should ask you to log in or create a new user. No recipes are shown at this point. <strong>If you're logged in</strong>, the following pages are available as navigation:
- Home Page/127.0.0.1: View all of the recipes you created
- All Recipes Page: View recipes by all users
- New Recipe Page: Create a new recipe
- Profile Page: See your personal page and edit any necessary information.

Each recipe on the **Home** and **All Recipes** pages should have the following:
- Picture of meal (with a link to details)
- Name of meal
- Short Description
- Date Created
- Creator of Recipe
- Edit Recipe Information (Only if you're on the home page)
- <strong>NOTE:</strong><em>IF</em> you are on the home page, include an edit link to edit ALL recipe information

If you click on the name of a recipe on the **Home** or **All Recipes** it should send you to a detailed recipe page:
- Picture of meal (with a link to details)
- Name of meal
- Ingredients for Meal
- Directions for Meal
- Date Created
- Creator of Recipe
- Back button somewhere on the page.

The profile page should allow you to edit the logged in users:
- Name
- Email Address
- Profile Picture
